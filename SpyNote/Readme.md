# SpyNote the famous RemoteAccsesTool, this copy is legit and should be clean
## Spynote is a Remote Access Trojan that initially surfaced in 2020. Since then, it has grown into one of the most common families of malware for Android, with multiple samples, integration of other RATs (e.g. CypherRat), and a large family of over 10,000 samples. There are multiple variants and integrations of other RATs, and since 2023 there has been a growing interest in financial institutions.
## On February 1st, we found a malicious sample posing as a legitimate crypto wallet that actually included the SpyNote RAT with several interesting additions related to anti-analysis and cryptocurrencies.
