CraxsRAT is a highly invasive Remote Access Trojan built to infect unsuspecting Android users. It is spread mainly via SMS phishing which tricks users into installing the RAT. Once the APK file is installed on the victimâ€™s phone, the malware can siphon off personal details of users which the threat actors can use to commit identity fraud, bank fraud and spy on the victims.
